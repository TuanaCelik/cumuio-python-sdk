### Tech Requirements

You will need `Python Version >= 3.6`

This package uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as its package manager. Make sure you have this installed.

### Create a PR

Once you've made changed that you're happy with, please create a PR back to the `luzmo:master`. Someone from our team will review the changes and if appropriate we will release a new version to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/luzmo/).
